# PatternPlotter Module Update Explanation

This document explains the updates made to the `PatternPlotter` module.

## Changes Made

### 1. Accessing Nested List Elements Correctly
- **Original**:
  ```elixir
  color = pattern |> List.keyfind({x, y}, 0)
  ```
- **Updated**:
  ```elixir
  color = pattern |> Enum.at(y) |> Enum.at(x)
  ```
  **Reason**: The original code used `List.keyfind` to find the color, which was incorrect. The updated code accesses nested list elements directly using `Enum.at`, ensuring that the correct pixel color is retrieved from the pattern.

### 2. Simplified Pattern Generation Functions
- **Original**:
  The original code used nested mappings to generate patterns, which was unnecessary and complicated.
- **Updated**:
  The updated code generates patterns directly as lists of lists with `Color` values, simplifying the logic and making it more efficient.
  - Example for checkerboard pattern:
    ```elixir
    defp generate_checkerboard(width, height) do
      for y <- 0..height-1 do
        for x <- 0..width-1 do
          if rem(x + y, 2) == 0, do: Color.white(), else: Color.black()
        end
      end
    end
    ```
  **Reason**: Simplifying pattern generation functions improves code readability and efficiency.

### 3. Improved Comments for Readability
- **Original**:
  The original comments were brief and lacked detail.
- **Updated**:
  The updated comments provide detailed explanations of each function and important steps within the functions.
  - Example:
    ```elixir
    # Function to generate a checkerboard pattern
    defp generate_checkerboard(width, height) do
      # Generate a checkerboard pattern with alternating black and white squares
      for y <- 0..height-1 do
        for x <- 0..width-1 do
          if rem(x + y, 2) == 0, do: Color.white(), else: Color.black()
        end
      end
    end
    ```
  **Reason**: Improved comments help other developers understand the code better, making maintenance and updates easier.

## Summary of Updates
- Corrected the method of accessing nested list elements when plotting pixels.
- Simplified the pattern generation logic for clarity and efficiency.
- Enhanced comments for better code readability and understanding.

These updates make the `PatternPlotter` module more robust, readable, and maintainable.
