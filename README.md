🚀 **Error Handling:** Robust error handling ensures smooth execution and provides informative error messages, helping you diagnose and fix issues quickly.

🔍 **Extensive Documentation:** Detailed comments and explanations within the code make it easy to understand and modify, even for beginners.

🔧 **Advanced Features:** Explore advanced features such as custom color schemes, experimental pattern generation, batch processing, and more.

🌐 **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** PatternPlotter is designed to work seamlessly on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

Follow these detailed steps to install and run PatternPlotter on your system:

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the PatternPlotter repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/PatternPlotter.git
cd PatternPlotter
```

### 2. Install Elixir

If you haven't already installed Elixir, you can do so by following the official installation guide for your operating system:

- [Official Elixir Installation Guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

### 3. Install :gaz Library

PatternPlotter relies on the :gaz library for graphics capabilities. Follow these steps to install it:

#### Add :gaz to Your `mix.exs` Dependencies

Open your `mix.exs` file and add `:gaz` to the list of dependencies:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:gaz, "~> 0.6.0"}
  ]
end
```

#### Fetch Dependencies

Run the following command to fetch the dependencies:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

### 4. Run the Application

To generate and plot a pattern, execute the following command:

```bash
elixir advanced_pattern_generator.ex
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can customize the pattern generation according to your requirements. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Modify Parameters:** Update the `width`, `height`, and `pattern_type` variables in the code to change the size and type of pattern.

2. **Customize Colors:** Optionally, you can customize the `foreground_color` and `background_color` variables to change the colors of the pattern.

3. **Run the Application:** Save the changes and run the application again to see the updated pattern.

## Advanced Usage

PatternPlotter offers advanced features for generating complex patterns and experimenting with different parameters. Here are some examples:

### Custom Color Schemes

Define custom color schemes by specifying RGB values for foreground and background colors. For example:

```elixir
foreground_color = Color.rgb(255, 0, 0) # Red color
background_color = Color.rgb(0, 255, 0) # Green color
```

### Experimental Patterns

Experiment with new pattern types by implementing custom pattern generation algorithms. Explore fractal patterns, cellular automata, and more.

### Batch Processing

Automate pattern generation by writing scripts that generate multiple patterns with varying parameters. This can be useful for generating datasets or conducting experiments.

## Example

Here's an example of how you can generate and plot a checkerboard pattern:

```elixir
width = 300
height = 300
pattern_type = :checkerboard

AdvancedPatternGenerator.plot_pattern(width, height, pattern_type)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while installing or running PatternPlotter, here are some troubleshooting tips:

- **Check Dependencies:** Ensure that you have Elixir and the :gaz library installed correctly. Follow the installation instructions carefully.

- **Verify Code Modifications:** Double-check any modifications you made to the code, such as parameter values or variable assignments.

- **Review Error Messages:** Pay attention to any error messages or warnings displayed during execution. They often contain valuable information about the problem.

- **Seek Community Support:** If you're still stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to the Elixir community for assistance. Online forums, chat rooms, and social media groups can be great resources for getting help.
